A borrower can borrow the cost of tuition plus X amount for other school-related expenses, the schools know there is no ceiling on how much they can charge while still being able to collect. As a result, they have increased tuition cost which results in higher loans which has resulted in higher tuition costs (and so goes the spiral upward).

They took advantage of the average ignorant investor that was horny to invest in a BABA/Amazon style stock at a cheap price. They over inflated their growth in their S1 by using \"logistics revenue\" (or shipping) during a global shutdown claiming that their 50%+ growth QoQ was sustainable. As you can see with every earnings since their IPO that style of accounting was smoke and mirrors to draw in people like you and OP that don't take time to read earnings reports before they dump their life savings into a company. There is more shady crap going on with WISH but this is a good example of why it's a trash company and a trash stock and also the reason for the recent downgrade. WISH would have to change their entire business model to be a $10 stock again. Their high point was lockdowns and those are gone. According to their earnings call their forward guidance calls for stagnation as their APP downloads have gone down, site traffic has gone down and shipping costs have gone up because of shortages.

Comparing them to baba or Amazon as a whole is too high of a standard. They’ve had a 20 year head start to develop their business. Wish has 1.6 billion in cash, and only 45 million in debt.
